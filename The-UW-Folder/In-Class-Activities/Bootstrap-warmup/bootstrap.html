                <p>The Olympic sport of dressage is derived from the French term meaning "training" and its purpose is
                    to
                    strengthen and supple the horse while maintaining a calm and attentive demeanor. The Pyramid of
                    Training
                    offers riders a progressive and interrelated system through which to develop the horse over time.

                    Currently, competitive dressage involves progressively difficult levels incorporating multiple tests
                    within each level. Each test is a series of movements that must be performed by the horse and rider.
                    Each movement is scored by a judge on a scale of 0-10. Special tests are also written for musical
                    freestyle, sport horse breeding and performances incorporating multiple horses and riders.

                <p>To Judges, Trainers, Competitors and Dressage Enthusiasts:
                    Without a standardized glossary, English-speaking dressage riders, trainers, and judges have been
                    communicating with each other using a language
                    which frequently is not understood the same way by the listener as by the speaker. We have had to
                    make do with interpretations and concepts of
                    vocabulary and terminology gleaned from the literature (much of it translated, and not always
                    accurately) with terms that are used differently by different
                    authors and that have different meanings and nuances in different languages.
                    The main purpose of this glossary is to improve understanding of, and standardize the usage of,
                    terminology used in judging and in communication
                    between judges. It is not intended to be a comprehensive lexicon of general dressage terminology.
                    It is hoped that it will improve the communication between judges, competitors, and trainers. If it
                    does fulfill that purpose, it cannot but help to improve
                    the quality of the judging itself, as well as increasing the learning value of the competitive
                    experience.
                    In determining definitions and usages, the overriding theme in this project has been agreement in
                    usage. “Borrowed” terms (from engineering, music,
                    etc.) have been taken “as is.” Dictionary definitions have been used wherever possible and where
                    sufficiently specific. In some cases, choice of definition
                    from among possible suggested or common (but often varying!) usages has been relatively arbitrary
                    based on “majority” input from the judging
                    community; however, in all cases dictionary definitions have been used at least as a taking-off
                    point. Even where there may exist some theoretical or
                    philosophical differences in personal interpretation or usage, it is nevertheless to the great
                    advantage of all concerned if standardized usages are
                    accepted and employed.
                    ABDUCT
                    To move a limb away from the horse’s midline.
                    ABOVE THE BIT
                    A head position in which the horse avoids acceptance of the contact by putting the muzzle forward
                    and upward, also usually retracting the poll.
                    ACCEPTANCE
                    Used in reference to the horse’s willingness to allow the maintenance of a steady contact, the
                    application of the aids, and/or the placement of the
                    rider’s weight. Absence of evasion or resistance.
                    ACTIVITY
                    Energy, vigor, liveliness - especially with reference to the motion of the hind legs.
                    ADDUCT
                    To move a limb toward or across the horse’s midline.
                    AGAINST THE BIT
                    The horse presses against the bit with a rigid or unyielding neck/poll/jaw.

                    ABDUCT
                    To move a limb away from the horse’s midline.
                    ABOVE THE BIT
                    A head position in which the horse avoids acceptance of the contact by putting the muzzle forward
                    and upward, also usually retracting the poll.
                    ACCEPTANCE
                    Used in reference to the horse’s willingness to allow the maintenance of a steady contact, the
                    application of the aids, and/or the placement of the
                    rider’s weight. Absence of evasion or resistance.
                    ACTIVITY
                    Energy, vigor, liveliness - especially with reference to the motion of the hind legs.
                    ADDUCT
                    To move a limb toward or across the horse’s midline.
                    AGAINST THE BIT
                    The horse presses against the bit with a rigid or unyielding neck/poll/jaw.

                <p>To Judges, Trainers, Competitors and Dressage Enthusiasts:
                    Without a standardized glossary, English-speaking dressage riders, trainers, and judges have been
                    communicating with each other using a language
                    which frequently is not understood the same way by the listener as by the speaker. We have had to
                    make do with interpretations and concepts of
                    vocabulary and terminology gleaned from the literature (much of it translated, and not always
                    accurately) with terms that are used differently by different
                    authors and that have different meanings and nuances in different languages.
                    The main purpose of this glossary is to improve understanding of, and standardize the usage of,
                    terminology used in judging and in communication
                    between judges. It is not intended to be a comprehensive lexicon of general dressage terminology.
                    It is hoped that it will improve the communication between judges, competitors, and trainers. If it
                    does fulfill that purpose, it cannot but help to improve
                    the quality of the judging itself, as well as increasing the learning value of the competitive
                    experience.
                    In determining definitions and usages, the overriding theme in this project has been agreement in
                    usage. “Borrowed” terms (from engineering, music,
                    etc.) have been taken “as is.” Dictionary definitions have been used wherever possible and where
                    sufficiently specific. In some cases, choice of definition
                    from among possible suggested or common (but often varying!) usages has been relatively arbitrary
                    based on “majority” input from the judging
                    community; however, in all cases dictionary definitions have been used at least as a taking-off
                    point. Even where there may exist some theoretical or
                    philosophical differences in personal interpretation or usage, it is nevertheless to the great
                    advantage of all concerned if standardized usages are
